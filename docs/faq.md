### Why use Freight?

You would use Freight if you are tired of waiting for `npm install` and `bower install`.

### Is Freight still useful if I git commit my modules?

If you commit `node_modules` and `bower_components` into your project
repository then you probably won't benefit from this project.

### How do I install the Freight Server?

See docs.

### How do I protect my Freight Server?

Use API keys.



### Why don't you just commit node_modules into git?
